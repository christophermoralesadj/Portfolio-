<h3>About me:</h3>
<br>
<h5>What brought me to this point? </h5>
<p>My name is Christopher Morales. I've been a teacher for the past 13 years. This October I decided to resign from my position as a teacher. Though I enjoyed what I was doing I felt like it was time for a change. After much research I decided to enroll in Nucamp's front-end bootcamp and to my surprise, I really enjoyed what I was doing.</p>
<br>
<h5>What's my educational background? </h5>
<p>I currently hold a Bachelor's degree in Finance. As mentioned above, I'm currenly enrolled in Nucamp's Coding Bootcamp. Since starting, I've decide to enroll in the Full-stack Bootcamp instead of just the font end.the great thing about being a former teacher is that you learn how to find answers. In my short exposure to web developement, I've learned that one of the most important skills you can have is not knowing everything but being able to find answers when you don't know something.</p>
<br>
<h5>What makes me a great candidate?</h5>
<p>As a teacher, I was known for being kind and considerate to others. I worked very well as a part of a team and was even a team leader for a few years. I'm a driven individual. When I set my focus on a task, there's nothing that will stop me from accomplishing that task. Lastly, when I do my job, I like to do it well.</p>
<br>
<h5>What's my motivation?</h5>
<p>Simply put, my family. I enjoy spending time with my family and would like to provide them with a good life.</p>
